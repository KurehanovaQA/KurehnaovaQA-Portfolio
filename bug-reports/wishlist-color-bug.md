Severity: Medium  
Type: Functional Bug  
Environment: Windows 10, Google Chrome

## Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open the e-commerce website 
2. Type "blanket" in the search bar (top left)  
3. Press Enter to display the search results  
4. Add any blanket to the Wishlist by clicking the heart icon  
5. Go to Wishlist (Favorites)  
6. Click on any available color option under the product

---

## Actual Result:
There is no visual indication of which color is selected.  
The color button does not highlight, and the product image does not change.  
As a result, the user cannot tell which color is selected before clicking "Add to Cart."

---

## Expected Result:
The selected color should be visibly highlighted, or the product image should update to reflect the chosen color.  
This would allow the user to clearly understand which variant they are about to add to the cart.

## Notes:
- The issue is only present in the Wishlist view.
- On the Product Details Page, color selection behaves correctly.
